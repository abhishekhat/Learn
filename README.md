📘 MLearning

This repository contains my journey of learning and implementing core **Machine Learning algorithms**.  
Each topic is organized with Jupyter notebooks and supporting datasets to demonstrate concepts, experiments, and projects.  

---

🚀 Implemented Topics

- **Supervised Learning**
  - Linear Regression
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)

- **Unsupervised Learning**
  - Clustering (K-means, Hierarchical, DBSCAN)
  - Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)

- **Reinforcement Learning**
  - Basic concepts and implementations in `Reinforce/`

---

## 📊 Datasets

- **car.csv** – used for classification and regression experiments.  
(More datasets will be added as projects progress.)

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 3.x  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- (Optional) TensorFlow / PyTorch for RL and deep learning parts  

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Build a strong foundation in classical ML algorithms.  
- Apply algorithms to real datasets with **hands-on projects**.  
- Explore reinforcement learning and unsupervised learning.  
- Eventually extend towards **Deep Learning and LLMs**.
